  <p id = main><em>Almost everyone knows that in today's digital world, technology is changing at a rapid pace. It has become quite normal to observe how alternative technologies often outperform each other, regularly updating and evolving. In the midst of all this, there is one area that suffers greatly from this changing nature of the technology world-and that is programming language! And today we will break down the most promising of these.</em></p>

  <h3><strong>Top Programming Languages That Will Rule in The Future</strong></h3>
  <ul>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>Go</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Ruby</li>
  <li>Swift</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h3><strong>JavaScript</strong></h3>
  <p>It’s impossible to be a software developer these days without using JavaScript in some way. According to Stack Overflow's 2020 Developer Survey, JavaScript is the most popular language among developers for the eighth year in a row. Nearly 70 percent of survey respondents reported that they had used JavaScript in the past year. Although JavaScript is primarily a front-end language run on the browser, it can also be used on the server-side through Node.js to build scalable network applications. Node.js is compatible with Linux, SunOS, Mac OS X, and Windows.</p>

  <h3><strong>Go</strong></h3>
  <p>One of the core languages favored by Google, Go is the little language that could. As a low-level language, Go is ideal for engineers who want to enter the field of systems programming. It encompasses much of the same functionality of C and C++ without the difficult syntax and steep learning curve. It’s the perfect language for building web servers, data pipelines, and even machine-learning packages.

As a compiled language, Go runs “close to the metal,” allowing for a blazing-fast runtime. It’s an open-source language, and ambitious developers can see their personal contributions adopted and enjoyed by programmers worldwide.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3><strong>Python</strong></h3>
  <p>Python is perhaps the most user-friendly programming language of any on this list. It’s often said that Python’s syntax is clear, intuitive, and almost English-like, which, like Java, makes it a popular choice for beginners.

Also like Java, Python has a variety of applications that make it a versatile, powerful option when choosing the best programming language for your use case. If you’re interested in back-end web development, for example, then the open-source Django framework, written in Python, is popular, easy to learn, and feature-rich. Django has been used in the development of some popular sites like Mozilla, Instagram, and Spotify.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3><strong>Ruby</strong></h3>
  <p>Ruby is another scripting language that’s commonly used for web development. In particular, it’s used as the basis for the popular Ruby on Rails web application framework. Ruby is also a good language to pick up thanks to its association with great tech businesses. Twitter, Airbnb, Bloomberg, Shopify, and countless other startups have all built their websites using Ruby on Rails at some point.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3><strong>Swift</strong></h3>
  <p>If you’re interested in Apple products and mobile app development, Swift is a good place to start. First announced by Apple in 2014, Swift is a relatively new programming language used to develop iOS and macOS applications.

Swift has been optimized for performance and built from the ground up to match the realities of modern iOS development. Not only does iOS run on every iPhone and iPad, but it’s also the basis for other operating systems such as watchOS (for Apple Watches) and tvOS (for Apple TVs). In addition, Apple isn't going anywhere as a tech industry leader, and iOS apps continue to be the most profitable in the mobile app marketplace.</p>

  <h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
  <p>Perspective is just a guess; it may or may not come. Prospective languages are ideal for learning as second programming languages. In any case, it is up to you to decide, so take your time and analyze everything qualitatively.But my personal top of pragramming languages is following</p>
  <ol>
    <li>  Python   </li>
    <li>  Swift   </li>
    <li>  JavaScript   </li>
    <li>  GO   </li>
    <li>  Ruby   </li>
  </ol>

  <p id = note> Anyhow, all such articles only guide you, and what kind of specialists you will become, depends only on you. The world of coding is not standing still. Search, try new things, and you will become a professional.</p>
